                <h2>Regional Migration Patterns in Central and Eastern Europe</h2>
                <p>Central and Eastern Europe presents a complex tapestry of migration flows, both within the region and beyond its borders. This section examines the intricate patterns of movement across countries like Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, and the Baltic states.</p>
                
                <p>Post-EU accession migration has fundamentally transformed the demographic landscape of the region, creating new opportunities while also presenting challenges for labor markets, social systems, and cultural identity.</p>
                
                <p>Understanding these cross-border movements requires examining not just the numbers, but the human stories behind the statistics - the motivations, experiences, and impacts of those who cross boundaries in search of better opportunities.</p>

                <h2>The EU Mobility Framework and Its Impacts</h2>
                <p>The European Union's freedom of movement has created unprecedented opportunities for CEE citizens, enabling them to work and study across member states without traditional visa restrictions.</p>
                
                <p>This mobility has generated both benefits and challenges: while individuals gain access to better economic opportunities, sending countries often face brain drain and demographic challenges, particularly in rural and less developed regions.</p>
                
                <p>Research shows that EU mobility patterns are increasingly circular and temporary, with many migrants maintaining strong ties to their home countries and contributing to transnational networks of knowledge and resource exchange.</p>

                <h2>Intra-Regional Dynamics</h2>
                <p>Migration within CEE reveals interesting patterns of regional integration and economic cooperation. Countries like Czech Republic and Poland have become both sending and receiving nations, attracting workers from Ukraine, Belarus, and other neighboring countries.</p>
                
                <p>These intra-regional flows highlight the growing economic integration of Central and Eastern Europe and its increasing role as a bridge between EU markets and Eastern European economies.</p>

            <article class="article">
                <h2>Cultural and Social Networks</h2>
                <p>Migration across CEE is facilitated by historical connections, linguistic similarities, and cultural affinities that transcend current political boundaries. These networks play crucial roles in migration decisions and settlement patterns.</p>
                
                <p>Understanding these cultural dimensions helps explain why certain migration corridors are more active than others and how social capital influences migration outcomes.</p>
