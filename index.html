                    <p>Exploring the demographics and motivations behind contemporary migration patterns in Central and Eastern Europe. This section examines who makes the decision to migrate, what drives their choices, and how personal circumstances intersect with broader socioeconomic factors.</p>
                    <p>Through detailed analysis of migration data and personal narratives, we uncover the complex interplay between individual agency and structural constraints that shape mobility decisions.</p>

                    <p>Understanding the other side of migration: those who choose to remain. This section investigates the factors that anchor people to their places of origin, examining how attachment, opportunity, and circumstance create patterns of immobility.</p>
                    <p>We explore how staying can be both a choice and a constraint, and how non-migrants contribute to and are affected by the migration of others in their communities.</p>
