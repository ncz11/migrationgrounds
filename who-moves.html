                <p>Migration patterns in Central and Eastern Europe reveal complex demographic trends that challenge simple narratives about who chooses to migrate. Our research examines the intersection of age, education, family status, and economic circumstances in shaping migration decisions.</p>
                
                <h3 class="article-title">Young Professionals Leading the Way</h3>
                <p>The data consistently shows that young adults between 25-35 years old represent the largest group of migrants from CEE countries. This demographic is characterized by higher education levels, fewer family commitments, and greater adaptability to new environments.</p>
                
                <h3 class="article-title">Educational Patterns</h3>
                <p>Interestingly, both highly educated professionals and those with vocational training show high migration rates, but for different reasons. University graduates often seek career advancement opportunities, while skilled workers are attracted by wage differentials in specific sectors like construction and healthcare.</p>
                
                <h3 class="article-title">Family Dynamics</h3>
                <p>Family migration patterns have evolved significantly since EU accession. We observe increased family reunification, chain migration processes, and strategic timing of moves around children's educational milestones.</p>
                
                <p>The decision to migrate is rarely individual—it involves complex negotiations within families, considerations of care responsibilities, and long-term planning that spans generations.</p>
